# Income Tracker
This is a system that helps landlords track money collected from their clients. For instance, a landlord can track the number of tenants who have paid their rent and those who have not. The goal is to visualise the health of a business based on the firmâ€™s bottom line, say 90% payment.

#### Team Members
Name: Sylvia Kwamboka Ratemo
Role: Full stack developer

#### Technologies
* Backend:
Programming Language: Python
Framework: Flask
Database: MySQL
* Frontend:
Programming languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript
Framework: JQuery, Flask

The choice of technologies is based on the ALX coursework and I would like to use the knowledge gained to create the system. Improvements and changes can be made as I delve deeper into the project.

#### Challenge
The idea arose from watching my father struggle to track rent collected from his tenants. A few of his tenants could live rent-free because of poor record keeping. While there are spreadsheets designed to help with income tracking, I believe a customizable app with visual features may be easier for him. 

Initially, the project will be restricted to tracking rent but in the future, I will include other functionalities that allow tracking of client payments for other firms such as internet providers.

#### Risks
Poor adoption
Learning curve
Technical difficulties

#### Infrastructure
The project will primarily utilize GitHub as the version control system, particularly the use of branches to minimize mistakes.

#### Development Strategy
I have yet to formally determine the deployment strategy but this will be considered and decided during the development phase. Nonetheless, CI/CD pipeline will be adopted.

#### Data Population
I have close proximity to a landlord, my father, hence I will populate the system with real data from his tenant. I will create users with various privileges who can add data and make modifications to the system.

#### Testing
Similarly to the choice technologies, I will utilize unit tests as a way to apply some of the knowledge gained from ALX. 

Existing Solutions
There are more complex systems available that track various aspects of rental properties. This system is limited to the tracking of income or rather monies paid by clients. By so doing, the project has a possibility to grow and include multiple forms of businesses in the future.
